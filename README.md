## Synopsis

**govtrack** is a Python package to scan a local government website and parse
the information into a standard format.
The goal of govtrack is to provide a unified interface to public government
websites and information.

## Motivation

**govtrack** was born out of a frustration with the often haphazard layout and
design of local government websites.  Without a standard style and presentation
format, simple information, such as which day of the week is garbage collected,
can be remarkably difficult to find and understand.

Rather than attempt to convince each of the thousands of local governments to
agree upon a standard web design, a more realistic solution is to simply parse
and extract the data in whatever format it is presented and provide it through
an entirely separate, alternate interface.

**govtrack**'s goal is to provided the back-end parsing and repackaging.
